Grasp
==============================

Experiment with deep learning architecture to predict grasping positions with deep neural networks using RGB images for robotic manipulation.

This implementation is mainly based on the very interesting idea from Redmon and Angelova described in [arXiv:1412.3128v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3128).

# Task
Figure 1 shows a simple and natural way of picturing the grasping position in an image would be a rectangle

Uses an RGB image to find a single grasp

Formally represent:

    g = {x, y, theta, h, w}

where (x,y) is the center of the rectangle, theta is the orientation of the rectangle to the horizontal axis of the image, _h_ and _w_ are the dimensions (height and width) of the rectangle.

The purpose of this project is to train a network that given a RGB image is able to predict a possible grasp _g_.

# Dataset
The images used to train the network are from [Cornell Grasping Dataset](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/grasping/rect_data/data.php).
